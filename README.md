# Psychic-Game

This is a Javascript game that we made in class to essentially make a game where the computer is choosing a predefined answer within an array.  The answer is pulled with an RNG, and then selected out of the array. The user then has to guess letters a-g, if they guess correct they win, if they use up all their guesses, they lose.

Please let me know how it is! There is also a little hint on how to get the first answer 100% right.
